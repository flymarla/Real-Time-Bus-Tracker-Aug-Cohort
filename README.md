# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Tracks the all buses on the number 1 route in Boston.  

This project demonstrates the concepts I have learned in my MIT xPro bootcamp this week.  
- using maps from MapBox
- getting data from an API
- adding markers to the map
- moving the markers using realtime updates
- styling the map and markers


Some improvements I made in my refactor were to change the style of the background map and also to change the style of the markers. I downloaded a bus marker from Mapbox and customized it to be blue on a yellow background instead of black and white.

Run this file by downloading the repository and loading the index.html file to a browser.

Future improvements I would like to make include adding a label for each marker.  If you click on a marker, I would like it to show additional information from the API such as bus label and occupancy status.
